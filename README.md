# Portfolio

## Description
I created this portfolio in order to showcase the projects and skills I have developed during my web development course at _nology, Bristol. 

My contact details are located at the top and bottom of the page and both my code and page previews are available using the links underneath the project images. 

Originally written in HTML and SCSS as my first major project on the course, I recently transferred the code over to React. Doing this meant that the I was able to use reusable components making the code appear in a well structured and logical format. 

## Future improvements 
I intend to create routes for each of the pages so they render separately as separate pages.
